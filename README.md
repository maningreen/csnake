# snake
snake written in c
make sure to compile it with compile.sh, for it was compiled for an armv8 device
then just execute snake
exit is 'Q'

Really i just wanted to learn how to make a terminal game. I learned c++ earlier this year
then a little bit of c, and then armv8 assembly. There will be an armv8 assembly version of this game.
It will come out later. I am not that smart.

# REQUIREMENTS

you need: unix based, make, gcc, and ncurses installed

how to compile: be in the projects directory, run make and it'll make

then you can execute snake in that directory
